Repository-state checks do not count.

## Parity objective

FortML targets workflow parity with the parts of the Python machine-learning
stack used for supervised tabular models and differentiable neural and Gaussian
process models. The reference behavior is:

- scikit-learn for estimator, transformer, pipeline, model-selection, metric,
  linear-classifier, and tree-boosting workflows.
- PyTorch and JAX for batches, train state, optimizer steps, device selection,
  and checkpoint resumption.
- GPyTorch and GPflow for Gaussian-process hyperparameter training, derivative
  observations, and approximate inference.

Parity means that a Fortran program can prepare data, fit, validate, serialize,
reload, and deploy the listed model families without a Python runtime. Public
names and array layouts remain Fortran-native. Numerical results must agree with
an analytic, dense, finite-difference, or pinned external reference within a
documented tolerance. API naming and floating-point instruction order need not
match the reference library.

The work packages below define the parity target. An item is complete when its
API, implementation, documentation, independent oracle, and refusal tests are
present.

## Current baseline

### Package and public contracts

- [x] Establish the MIT-licensed package with sibling `fortnum`, `fortopt`,
  `fortad`, and `fortsparse` dependencies and separate public Fortran modules.

  white-noise kernels, plus recursive sum and product kernels.
- [x] Implement validated bounded postfix formulas for user kernels and lower
  eligible formulas into the generic kernel-operator program.
- [x] Supply kernel matrix products, parameter JVP/VJP/HVP products, input
  derivatives, generated radial derivative kernels, and independent analytic,
  finite-difference, adjoint, and `fortsym` checks.
- [x] Implement exact multi-output-column GP regression with Cholesky inference,
  latent predictive variance, log marginal likelihood, hyperparameter
  gradients, prediction products, and differentiated-solve HVPs.
- [x] Implement mixed function-value and first-derivative observations with
  explicit Matérn smoothness and white-noise refusal rules.
- [x] Implement correlated multi-output GPs and scalar-target inducing-point
  variational GPs with caller-supplied variational parameters.

### Lazy and structured inference

- [x] Define the abstract linear-operator contract for vector and multi-right-
  hand-side products, diagonals, sample counts, CG, and independent batched CG
  recurrences.
- [x] Implement specialized RBF and generic composable-kernel operators with
  cached data residency, fused products, diagonal preconditioning, and dense
  solve oracles.
- [x] Add block and Nyström preconditioners, stochastic Lanczos log
  determinants, and LOVE-style predictive-variance products.
- [x] Implement compact-support sparse operators through `fortsparse`, including
  CSC construction, host products, nonzero diagnostics, and a resident
  OpenACC CSR view.
- [x] Implement separable tensor-product operators with vector, batched,
  derivative, CG, and resident OpenACC products.
- [x] Implement cached one-dimensional Toeplitz products, multilevel-grid
  prolongation and restriction, and banded Markov precision factorization,
  solves, and log determinants.
- [x] Add a declared-structure inference policy for dense Cholesky, tensor
  grids, compact support, banded precision, matrix-free Krylov, and inducing
  points.

### Accelerator backends

- [x] Add correctness-gated tiled RBF vector and batched products with OpenACC
  residency and `nvfortran` compilation.
- [x] Add device CG paths that retain lowered kernel programs, data, right-hand
  sides, and reusable workspaces across products and solves.
- [x] Define a backend-neutral opaque C ABI for resident matrix-free plans and
  implement the CUDA backend for generic postfix products.
- [x] Add optional native CUDA shared-neighbor tiles for the fixed
  eight-feature RBF vector and batched paths, with OpenACC fallbacks.
- [x] Consume a `fortsym`-generated RBF CUDA leaf through the resident postfix
  plan and check the resident-plan path against independent dense products.

### Approximate Gaussian processes

- [x] Implement subset-of-data selection and the SoR/DTC/FITC/PITC prior
  approximations with independent dense posterior and likelihood oracles.
- [x] Implement the variational inducing-point path used by the VFE benchmark
  driver.
- [x] Implement one-dimensional Toeplitz SKI and multidimensional Kronecker SKI
  with local multilinear interpolation, matrix-free CG, diagonals, batched
  products, and interpolated train-to-query cross products.
- [x] Implement NLE/PoE/GPoE/BCM/RBCM/GRBCM and entropy-gated MoE
  aggregation with balanced contiguous or deterministic Lloyd partitions.
- [x] Implement the GRBCM communication-set semantics from Liu et al., *When
  Gaussian Process Meets Big Data*, IEEE TNNLS 31(11), Eq. (29): seeded
  selection without replacement, disjoint remainder partitions, enhanced
  experts on `D_c` union `D_i`, the first unit coefficient, later unclipped
  entropy coefficients, and the communication-expert correction.
- [x] Add the review toy problem and one benchmark driver for exact, inducing,
  SKI, local-expert, clustered local-expert, and matrix-free comparison lanes.

### Benchmark applications

- [x] Add correctness-gated applications for linear regression, MLP, exact GP,
  GP feature products, and approximate GP workloads.
- [x] Have the applications emit correctness results and timed phases in
  machine-readable output. The approximate GP driver emits explicit NaN rows
  for preflight refusals.
- [x] Use the sibling `../fortml-bench` harnesses to add peak RSS, build and
  toolchain provenance, release measurements, and external Python comparisons.

## Supported boundaries

Multidimensional SKI accepts one isotropic RBF leaf. Its `n_grid` argument is a
maximum total grid budget. Every axis receives the largest common extent `q`
such that `q**d <= n_grid`, and each interpolation row has `2**d` corners.
Queries outside the training box clamp to its nearest face. The benchmark driver
reports an SKI mean and marks predictive variance undefined.

Local fits use balanced contiguous blocks by default or deterministic Lloyd
clusters through `fit_clustered`. GRBCM requires at least two reported experts.
Its fixed default communication seed is reproducible, and callers may supply a
different seed. MoE uses an entropy-score softmax gate. The gate and inducing
locations are not learned jointly with model parameters.

The benchmark VFE lane constructs its variational distribution with dense
linear algebra. It is not a minibatch stochastic-variational implementation.
Toeplitz FFT products remain host-resident.

Accelerator support is operator-specific. OpenACC and native CUDA paths cover
the kernel, structured, and sparse operations documented above. The
`nvfortran` verification establishes compiler compatibility for all 30 tests.
It does not establish that every model trains or predicts entirely on a GPU.

## Parity work packages

The source inventory is dated 2026-08-07.

| Work package | State | Implemented baseline | Package exit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Classification | Partial | `fortml_logistic_regression` provides binary integer-label fitting, stable probabilities, deterministic class order, and FortOpt L-BFGS-B optimization. Shared losses, metrics, multiclass models, and weighting are open. | Binary and multiclass linear, neural, GP, and boosted-tree classifiers share label, probability, weighting, and metric conventions. |
| Estimator contracts, pipelines, and bases | Partial | `basis_map_t`, row-oriented sample conventions, status objects, and the parameter registry are public. | Fitted transformers and estimators compose without data leakage, expose routed parameters, and run through cross-validation. |
| Tree boosting | Missing | No tree, split finder, histogram builder, or ensemble module exists. | Regression and classification trees support deterministic histogram boosting, validation-based stopping, missing values, and model persistence. |
| Training infrastructure | Partial | Model-specific gradients, `fortopt_adam` integration, natural-gradient seams, and seeded variational draws exist. | One trainer owns batches, optimizer state, schedules, clipping, validation, early stopping, callbacks, and resumable state for every model with a completed trainer adapter. |
| GP derivatives and hyperparameters | Partial | Exact GP likelihood and prediction products include parameter gradients and HVPs. Mixed value and first-derivative observations can be fitted and predicted. | Exact, derivative, multi-output, sparse, and matrix-free GP families expose documented trainable parameters, scalar objectives, parameter gradients, and train-state adapters. |
| GPU and device execution | Partial | Kernel, structured, and sparse operator products have selected OpenACC or CUDA paths, including resident CG for kernel operators. | Supported training and prediction workflows keep model, optimizer, and batch state resident on a selected device and have CPU parity tests. |
| Serialization and distributed execution | Missing | No public model-file or distributed-execution contract exists. | Versioned model and trainer files round-trip across supported compilers, and MPI training or inference agrees with a one-rank oracle. |
| Benchmark coverage | Partial | Correctness-gated model and GP applications feed release harnesses in `../fortml-bench`. | Every completed parity package has a pinned external oracle, release timings, memory measurements, provenance, raw data, and a maintained report. |

### WP1: classification

- [ ] Define one public class-label contract. Classes have a deterministic order,
  predicted labels use that order to break ties, and probability matrices have
  one column per class.
- [x] Add binary logistic regression with an intercept, L2 regularization,
  `fit`, `decision_function`, `predict_proba`, and `predict`.
- [ ] Add sample weights and class weights to binary logistic regression while
  preserving the documented reduction and class-label contract.
- [ ] Add multinomial softmax regression with a numerically stable log-sum-exp
  objective and the same weighting contract.
- [ ] Add classifier adapters for `mlp_t` and variational GP classification.
  Each adapter owns its likelihood and training objective instead of treating a
  raw network or GP mean as a probability.
- [ ] Add accuracy, balanced accuracy, confusion matrix, log loss, precision,
  recall, F1, and binary ROC AUC with explicit zero-division and sample-weight
  behavior.
- [ ] Add probability calibration by sigmoid and isotonic fits after the base
  classifier API is stable.

Acceptance: hand-computed separable and nonseparable fixtures cover labels,
weights, ties, and probabilities. Objective gradients agree with central finite
differences. A pinned scikit-learn harness compares coefficients or decision
scores where the objectives match and compares probabilities and metrics for all
public classifiers. Invalid labels, nonfinite data, empty classes, and mismatched
weights return status errors.

### WP2: estimator contracts, pipelines, and feature bases

- [x] Provide polynomial, Fourier, radial, B-spline, and callback basis maps with
  value, JVP, and VJP products.
- [x] Provide row-oriented sample conventions, explicit status results, and a
  registry for packed model parameters.
- [ ] Define fitted transformer, predictor, regressor, and classifier contracts.
  The contracts cover feature counts, fitted state, reset or clone behavior,
  parameter names, and status propagation.
- [ ] Add standard and min-max scaling, constant and mean imputation, one-hot
  encoding with a stored category order, and column selection.
- [ ] Add sequential pipelines, parallel feature unions, and column-wise
  transformers. Basis maps must work as fitted or fixed pipeline stages.
- [ ] Add deterministic train/test, K-fold, stratified K-fold, and grouped split
  iterators plus cross-validation scoring and routed parameters.
- [ ] Add grid and seeded random parameter search after estimator cloning and
  scoring are stable.

Acceptance: pipeline predictions equal a manually composed reference for each
stage. Cross-validation tests prove that transformer statistics use training
folds only. Split indices have seeded known answers. Parameter routing reaches
exactly one named stage, and a stage failure preserves its original status.
Examples cover regression and classification pipelines with mixed numeric and
categorical columns.

### WP3: trees and histogram boosting

- [ ] Add deterministic CART regression and classification trees with weighted
  squared-error, Gini, and entropy criteria, depth and leaf constraints, and a
  specified tie rule.
- [ ] Add weighted quantile binning and per-feature histograms. Store missing
  values in a dedicated bin and learn a default branch at every split.
- [ ] Add gradient-boosted regression for squared, absolute, and Huber losses.
- [ ] Add binary and multiclass gradient-boosted classification with stable
  logistic and softmax objectives.
- [ ] Add learning-rate shrinkage, row and feature subsampling, L1 and L2 leaf
  penalties, validation-based early stopping, warm starts, and deterministic
  feature importance.
- [ ] Add categorical split support only after numeric and missing-value
  behavior has independent oracles and benchmark evidence.

Acceptance: small trees reproduce exhaustive hand-enumerated split searches,
including weighted and missing-value cases. Training loss is nonincreasing for
the exact line-search fixtures. Fixed seeds reproduce tree structures and
predictions. Pinned scikit-learn or XGBoost workloads compare probabilities and
regression predictions under matched objectives. Release benchmarks record fit
and predict time, peak memory, tree count, depth, and histogram size.

### WP4: training infrastructure

- [x] Expose packed parameters and model-specific JVP, VJP, HVP, or gradient
  products for the current trainable neural and exact GP models.
- [x] Check one MLP update seam with `fortopt_adam`, and expose natural-gradient
  or `fortopt` update seams for Gaussian variational families.
- [ ] Define objective and loss contracts with sum and mean reductions, sample
  weights, regularization terms, and named scalar diagnostics.
- [ ] Add a deterministic batch iterator with seeded shuffling, final-batch
  behavior, and separate training and validation streams.
- [ ] Add a trainer that owns optimizer state, learning-rate schedules, gradient
  clipping, accumulation, validation intervals, early stopping, and callbacks.
- [ ] Add trainer adapters for linear classifiers, MLPs, BNNs, VAEs, RNNs, exact
  GPs, derivative GPs, and sparse variational GPs. Each adapter requires a scalar
  objective, parameter gradient, reduction rule, and complete train-state update.
- [ ] Define in-memory train state independently of file serialization. It must
  include parameters, optimizer accumulators, epoch and batch positions, RNG
  streams, schedules, and early-stopping state.

Acceptance: each adapter has an independent gradient oracle and a fixture whose
objective decreases under a documented optimizer configuration. Two runs with
the same seeds produce the same batches and parameter history. Saving train
state in memory at a batch boundary and resuming it reproduces the uninterrupted
CPU run. Callback order, early stopping, clipping, and failed optimizer steps
have known-answer tests.

### WP5: GP derivatives and hyperparameter training

- [x] Expose exact GP log marginal likelihood gradients, JVPs, HVPs, prediction
  JVPs, VJPs, and differentiated-solve HVPs for kernel and noise parameters.
- [x] Fit and predict mixed function values and first input derivatives with
  kernel smoothness and white-noise refusal rules.
- [x] Expose kernel parameter products and input gradients plus mixed input
  Hessians for the supported analytic kernels.
- [ ] Add trainable constant and linear mean functions and automatic relevance
  determination length scales. Parameter packing must include mean, kernel,
  likelihood, and optional inducing-location blocks in a documented order.
- [ ] Add bounded hyperparameter optimization with multiple seeded restarts,
  priors, jitter escalation, convergence diagnostics, and retained best state.
- [ ] Add likelihood gradients and HVPs for derivative-observation GPs, including
  noise parameters for each observation type.
- [ ] Add joint posterior covariance for value and derivative queries, plus
  cross-covariances between requested components.
- [ ] Extend derivative observations to second derivatives only for kernels with
  the required smoothness, with explicit refusal at singular coincident cases.
- [ ] Add scalar objectives and parameter gradients for multi-output, sparse
  variational, local, SKI, Lanczos, and matrix-free GP paths. Inducing-point and
  local-gate training remain separate parameter blocks.
- [ ] Add Bernoulli and multiclass variational GP classification after the shared
  classifier likelihood and metric contracts are complete.

Acceptance: every new derivative agrees with central finite differences and an
independently assembled dense covariance on small fixtures. Hyperparameter fits
reproduce seeded trajectories and retain the best finite objective. Pinned
GPyTorch or GPflow comparisons cover posterior means, variances, derivative
covariances, likelihoods, and optimized parameters under matched kernels and
jitter. Boundary tests cover smoothness, duplicate inputs, nonfinite parameters,
and failed factorizations.

### WP6: GPU and device execution

- [x] Provide correctness-gated OpenACC kernel, structured, and sparse products,
  resident kernel-operator CG, and an opaque CUDA plan for postfix kernels.
- [x] Verify the full host test suite with `nvfortran`; this is compiler coverage,
  not end-to-end GPU coverage.
- [ ] Define a public device selector and ownership contract for host and CUDA
  allocations, streams, synchronization, and recoverable backend refusal.
- [ ] Keep batches, parameters, gradients, optimizer accumulators, and workspaces
  resident through complete MLP and variational training steps.
- [ ] Add resident exact or matrix-free GP prediction and hyperparameter-gradient
  paths, including preconditioned CG and batched LOVE work.
- [ ] Add device Toeplitz transforms, SKI interpolation, sparse variational
  products, and histogram construction one path at a time. Retain a path when a
  correctness-gated release workload reduces median time beyond its recorded
  run-to-run dispersion or reduces peak host memory.
- [ ] Extend the backend ABI to one non-CUDA accelerator runtime after the CUDA
  ownership and error contracts are stable.
- [ ] Add device memory accounting, leak checks, and transfer counters to the
  benchmark harness.

Acceptance: each device kernel agrees with an independent CPU oracle across
boundary shapes and noncontiguous batch sizes. A timed training step performs no
implicit host transfer after residency begins. Repeated create, train, predict,
and destroy cycles return device memory to the baseline. Unsupported devices or
features return a status and leave host state usable. Release reports include
backend, compiler, driver, device, precision, transfer count, and peak device
memory.

### WP7: serialization and distributed execution

- [ ] Define a versioned model schema with type tags, dimensions, dtypes,
  parameter layout versions, kernel trees, basis definitions, preprocessing
  statistics, class order, and optional fitted state.
- [ ] Add save and load procedures for each completed estimator and pipeline.
  Callback bases and user kernel callbacks require registered stable names or an
  explicit serialization refusal.
- [ ] Add trainer checkpoints containing optimizer, schedule, RNG, batch,
  validation, and early-stopping state.
- [ ] Specify compatibility rules for newer readers, reject unknown required
  fields, and provide migrations for every released schema change.
- [ ] Add MPI data-parallel training with deterministic gradient reduction for
  trainer-compatible dense models.
- [ ] Add sharded prediction and matrix-free products for data sets that do not
  fit one rank. Collective failure must return the same status on every rank.
- [ ] Add distributed checkpoint coordination and rank-local temporary files
  with atomic publication of the completed checkpoint.

Acceptance: model round trips preserve parameters, metadata, and predictions
across GNU and NVIDIA compiler builds. Golden files from every supported schema
version remain readable. An interrupted write never replaces the last complete
checkpoint. One-rank and two-rank runs agree within a documented reduction
tolerance, and fixed process counts reproduce results. MPI tests cover empty
shards, uneven final batches, and one-rank failure propagation.

### WP8: benchmark and parity evidence

- [x] Provide correctness-gated applications for linear regression, MLP, exact
  GP, GP feature products, and approximate or matrix-free GP methods.
- [x] Record release timings, peak RSS, build provenance, external Python
  comparisons, raw CSV files, and plots through `../fortml-bench`.
- [ ] Define one versioned result schema for correctness, train time, predict
  time, peak host and device memory, compiler, flags, dependency revisions,
  hardware, seed, warmup, repetitions, and refusal reason.
- [ ] Add pinned external oracle harnesses for every completed classifier,
  transformer pipeline, boosted tree, trainer, GP derivative, and serialization
  package.
- [ ] Add workload tiers for unit-size correctness, CI smoke runs, single-node
  release measurements, accelerator runs, and multi-rank scaling.
- [ ] Store median and dispersion across repetitions, separate compile and warmup
  costs, and prevent debug profiles from entering performance reports.
- [ ] Define regression thresholds only after two release baselines on the same
  hardware. A threshold failure must retain the raw result and identify the
  changed code and toolchain revisions.
- [ ] Publish one maintained report per parity package with workload definitions,
  correctness tolerances, refused cases, raw-data links, and plots or tables.

Acceptance: a report can be regenerated from raw artifacts without editing the
data. Every timed row has passed its independent correctness gate in the same
build. Missing hardware or infeasible workloads emit parseable refusal records.
The harness records enough provenance to rebuild the tested FortML and sibling
dependencies.

### WP9: physics-consistent, Hamiltonian, and symplectic models

FortML should support scientific models in which the differential equation,
conservation law, or geometric structure is part of the model contract. This
work package is a research track. It becomes an implementation claim only when
the residual, derivative, and long-horizon behavior have independent tests.

The literature establishes several complementary directions:

- [Hamiltonian Neural Networks](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/9672-hamiltonian-neural-networks.pdf)
  parameterize a scalar Hamiltonian and obtain the vector field from the
  canonical symplectic gradient.
- [Symplectic learning for Hamiltonian neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11753)
  analyzes the discretization error introduced by the training integrator and
  motivates training through a symplectic map.
- [Physics-informed neural networks](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2018.10.045)
  combine data and differential-equation residuals in one objective. The
  [PIML review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05624) surveys physics-guided,
  physics-informed, and physics-encoded architectures and the different ways
  equations and domain knowledge enter a model.
- [Physics consistency of infinite neural networks](https://ml4physicalsciences.github.io/2023/files/NeurIPS_ML4PS_2023_9.pdf)
  by Sascha Ranftl connects kernels satisfying linear differential constraints
  to the infinite-width neural-network limit. Its finite-width construction is
  an approximation to the limiting GP, so FortML will test seeded ensembles
  against that covariance instead of claiming an exact initializer.
- A forthcoming TU Graz DocDay abstract by Johanna Moser describes the
  [Ghosttasking and Monge-GP direction](https://www.tugraz.at/sites/dsp/docdays/past-docdays/september-2026)
  for physics-informed GPs for linear differential equations, including
  parameter inference outside the constant-coefficient and controllable cases.
- [Symplectic Neural Gaussian Processes](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2024/465)
  combines a GP Hamiltonian with a learned system representation for
  data-efficient Hamiltonian dynamics.
- [Lagrangian Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04630),
  [SympNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03750), and
  [symplectic recurrent neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13334)
  provide complementary structure-preserving architectures.
- [Direct Poisson neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05540) extend the
  target beyond nondegenerate canonical symplectic systems to Poisson systems.

The project-specific symplectic-GP and Hamiltonian/ANN benchmark results from
the FortML authors and Katharina Rath are a required pinned reference set. The
roadmap records the interface and reproduction work without treating private
results as an external literature claim.

#### WP9a: physics contracts and autodiff products

- [ ] Define a `physics_constraint_t` callback with residual value, JVP, VJP,
  and HVP products. Callbacks declare state, parameter, coordinate, and time
  layouts, units, boundary masks, and reduction weights.
- [ ] Add data, PDE/ODE residual, initial or boundary, conservation, and
  symplectic-form terms to one composable objective. Include nondimensionalizing
  transforms and named diagnostics for every term.
- [ ] Add collocation and trajectory samplers with seeded random, adaptive
  residual, boundary, and event-aware policies. A sampler records the points it
  emitted so a run can be reproduced exactly.
- [ ] Add residual derivatives through `fortad` or an equivalent analytic
  product path. The current `fortad` `main` checkout is the baseline. Use
  `fortsym` to derive and emit a kernel when symbolic differentiation produces a
  smaller proven expression, then verify the emitted code against the symbolic
  identity and an independent numerical oracle. A physics objective must not
  rely on finite differences in its production training path.
- [ ] Record the `fortad` and `fortsym` revisions, proof strength, operation
  count, and fallback reason in generated-kernel provenance.

The repository snapshot used for this roadmap resolves `fortad` `main` at
`e4345f9` and `fortsym` `main` at `58a0e06`. Future derivative work must refresh
both checkouts before deciding that a product is unavailable.

#### WP9b: Hamiltonian, Lagrangian, and symplectic networks

- [ ] Add `hamiltonian_mlp_t` with scalar H(q,p), canonical J, symplectic
  gradient, optional learned skew structure matrix, and parameter/input
  products. Promote that matrix to a Poisson structure only after skew
  symmetry and the Jacobi identity have independent tests.
- [ ] Add `lagrangian_mlp_t` with Euler-Lagrange residuals, mass-matrix checks,
  and a refusal for a singular velocity Hessian. Positive definiteness is an
  additional requirement only for a separable mechanical mass metric.
- [ ] Add SympNet and symplectic recurrent map variants with architecture-
  specific composition certificates and a testable symplectic Jacobian. A
  generating-function certificate is required only for an architecture that
  explicitly uses one.
- [ ] Add differentiable symplectic Euler, Verlet, and higher-order splitting
  integrators for separable or otherwise splittable Hamiltonians. General
  Hamiltonians require an applicable implicit symplectic method or an explicit
  refusal. Training can differentiate through the map, while inference reports
  the integrator and step size used.
- [ ] Add gauge handling for additive constants in H and for the Lagrangian
  equivalence `L -> L + dF(q,t)/dt`, canonical versus noncanonical coordinates,
  and optional noisy derivative observations.
- [ ] Add conservation, reversibility, volume or symplectic-form error, and
  long-horizon trajectory metrics to the benchmark schema.

#### WP9c: physics-consistent and symplectic GPs

- [ ] Generalize derivative observations from coordinate gradients to registered
  linear differential operators. The operator registry provides value, adjoint,
  and mixed-operator covariance products and rejects unsupported smoothness.
- [ ] Add physics-consistent kernels and mean functions for linear ODE/PDE
  constraints, boundary conditions, and Green-function constructions. Include
  Ghosttasking and Monge-GP prototypes behind explicit experimental modules.
- [ ] Add symplectic GP priors for scalar Hamiltonians and vector fields.
  Construct `f = J grad(H)` for canonical systems or `f = P grad(H)` for
  Poisson systems, where the structure tensor is the antisymmetric object.
  Expose joint covariance for values, derivatives, and cross-components, and
  test symplectic, divergence, or Jacobi properties as applicable.
- [ ] Add trainable equation parameters, operator hyperparameters, and noise
  blocks to the optimizer-ready parameter registry. FortOpt L-BFGS-B and
  bounded multi-start diagnostics are the reference training path.
- [ ] Compare physics-consistent GP posterior means, covariances, and recovered
  parameters against an independently assembled dense operator GP on small
  fixtures.

#### WP9d: GP-limit, PCA, and linear-optimum initialization

- [ ] Implement NNGP covariance propagation for the supported MLP depth,
  activations, weight and bias priors, and widths, following the [deep-network
  GP correspondence](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00165). On a user design set,
  estimate covariance from a seeded finite-width ensemble and report its error,
  mean, and variance calibration against the limiting kernel.
- [ ] Add three separate MLP initialization contracts: a sampled prior draw,
  deterministic fitting of a GP posterior mean, and last-layer kernel-ridge
  initialization. Each records the kernel, architecture, width, seed, design
  set, and solve tolerance, and states whether it promises a mean fit or a
  covariance approximation.
- [ ] Add PCA initialization for linear autoencoders, following the
  [principal-component initialization proposal](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-30484-3_14).
  The encoder and decoder
  use the selected principal subspace, with centering, whitening, rank, and
  sign conventions recorded. The reconstruction oracle must match the PCA
  projection to numerical tolerance.
- [ ] Add GP or basis-map initialization for nonlinear autoencoders and VAEs.
  The linear optimum is the starting point, while nonlinear layers begin with
  an identity or contractive perturbation whose reconstruction and Jacobian
  products are tested.
- [ ] Add physics-consistent and symplectic initializers that preserve the
  declared operator or form at initialization. Compare convergence from random,
  Xavier/He, PCA, NNGP, and GP-posterior starts under identical seeds and
  optimizer budgets.

#### WP9e: scientific benchmark matrix

- [ ] Add analytic harmonic oscillator, pendulum, Kepler/two-body, and
  Hénon-Heiles workloads. Compare standard MLP, HNN, LNN, SympNet/SRNN, exact
  GP, symplectic GP, and GP-initialized networks.
- [ ] Add graph differential-operator workloads for irregular domains, using
  the [physics-informed graph-network construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08332)
  and a manufactured graph oracle for node and edge residuals.
- [ ] Add Poisson, heat, Burgers, and wave equation workloads with manufactured
  solutions. Compare PINN residual training, physics-consistent GP priors,
  derivative observations, and a numerical solver reference.
- [ ] Add Ghosttasking and Monge-GP inverse-problem fixtures once the public
  equation definitions and reference implementations are pinned.
- [ ] Record short- and long-horizon trajectory error, energy drift, symplectic
  defect, residual and boundary norms, parameter recovery, posterior calibration,
  wall time, memory, and optimizer evaluations. Refused combinations remain
  parseable benchmark rows.
- [ ] Publish a reproducible comparison against the author's symplectic-GP and
  Hamiltonian/ANN benchmark results, including the exact data generation,
  integrator, step size, model width, seed, and stopping criteria.

Acceptance: every model has an analytic or manufactured-solution oracle,
finite-difference checks for the public products, and a structure check for
each declared invariant. Symplectic tests measure the Jacobian form defect.
Energy tests distinguish true-system energy error from learned-Hamiltonian
drift. Forced, dissipative, and time-dependent systems are not required to
conserve energy. GP and finite-network initializations reproduce their declared
design-set mean, covariance approximation, or projection. Long-horizon
conclusions use the same integrator and sampling budget for every baseline, and
every release row links to raw data and the pinned reference.

## Benchmark evidence

The maintained reports and their raw artifacts are in `../fortml-bench/results`:

- [`MODEL_WORKLOADS.md`](../fortml-bench/results/MODEL_WORKLOADS.md), backed by
  `model_workloads.csv`, `exact_gp_workloads.png`, and `mlp_workloads.png`.
- [`GP_FEATURES.md`](../fortml-bench/results/GP_FEATURES.md), backed by
  `gp_features.csv` and `gp_features.png`.
- [`CLASSIFICATION.md`](../fortml-bench/results/CLASSIFICATION.md), backed by
  `classification_workloads.csv` with FortML and scikit-learn provenance.
- Corrected GRBCM evidence in `scalable_gp_grbcm_corrected.csv` and
  `scalable_gp_grbcm_corrected_train_seconds.png`.
- Current partition and dimension evidence in `scalable_gp_clustered.csv` and
  `scalable_gp_dimension_current.csv`.

Those reports contain the workload definitions, compiler flags, hardware records,
correctness gates, raw timings, and plots. This roadmap contains no copied
timing numbers.

GRBCM results produced before the communication-set and enhanced-expert
correction are superseded. Use the corrected CSV and plot above for GRBCM
claims.

## Completion gate for later changes

A code item is complete when its implementation, public documentation, focused
tests, and an independent behavioral oracle agree. Run bare `fo` before
handoff. Compiler-sensitive changes also require the relevant compiler lane.

A performance claim additionally needs a release build, a recorded workload and
toolchain, a correctness result, raw data, and a plot or table in
`../fortml-bench/results`. Timings from the checked debug profile are invalid as
performance evidence.

## Delivery order

Benchmark and documentation work ships with each implementation slice. The
dependency order for the remaining code is:

1. Complete the classification contract around the binary logistic baseline:
   shared stable losses, sample and class weights, accuracy, confusion matrix,
   and log loss. Then add multinomial softmax regression. These rules establish
   the probability and weighting conventions used by pipelines, neural
   classifiers, GP classification, and boosted trees.
2. Add the fitted estimator and transformer contracts, standard scaling, and a
   sequential pipeline. Adapt linear regression and binary logistic regression
   before adding feature unions or parameter search.
3. Add deterministic batches, the common objective contract, trainer state, and
   one MLP trainer adapter. Define the checkpoint schema once the in-memory state
   has a resumption oracle.
4. Implement exact CART fixtures, then the numeric histogram builder and
   regression boosting. Add classification losses after WP1 metrics and
   probabilities are stable.
5. Add GP mean functions, automatic relevance determination, and bounded exact
   GP hyperparameter training. Derivative-GP likelihood products and sparse
   training follow on the same optimizer contract.
6. Move complete trainer and GP steps onto the existing CUDA residency layer.
   Add MPI reduction only after train state and checkpoint ownership are fixed.
7. Add the physics contracts, Hamiltonian/symplectic models, and operator-GP
   prototypes behind independent residual and structure oracles.
8. Add GP-limit, PCA, and physics-consistent initialization experiments before
   making them default training behavior. Expand external and release benchmark
   lanes with every slice. Run the `ifx` compiler lane when an installation is
   available.
